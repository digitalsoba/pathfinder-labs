# Pathfinder-labs
This repo contains all the combined labs for META+LAB's Pathfinder program. More info on each lab is found inside their respective folder. It's recommended to use a UNIX based environment with the following requirements installed: Docker, Ansible, a terminal, and AWS access to EC2 instances. 

## Ansible lab
This lab will use vagrant or docker to provision a local Ubuntu machine.

## Docker lab
This focuses on building Docker images from the ground and running these as containers.

## EC2 + Ansible lab
This lab will go through the process of creating an EC2 instance, running an ansible playbook, and creating an image from that provisioned machine.
